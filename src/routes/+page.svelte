		My name is Ben, I'm a Canadian üçÅ living out of Ottawa, Ontario (in an Igloo ‚òÉÔ∏è). I work as a
		Software Developer full-time and work a pretty wide range of projects in my personal time. Catch
		me working on C++ building the base for a game engine one day, and practicing my drawing skills
		another day.
	</p>
	<p>
		I started with an internship at a small company in my hometown which after graduation became a
		full time position. I wanted to move back to Ottawa so I found myself a job at Mitel and moved
		back in 2020 just in time for lockdown. My time at Mitel was great and I worked with some
		amazing people, eventually I was referred to another company by a former colleague and decided
		to take up the opportunity that presented itself to me.

		While Software Development is my main career there are many things I love to do in my off time.
		One such thing has been developing games on the side, So far I have participated in 2 GameJams!

		I am also an amateur rock climber and been climbing for the past year, I love going to the gym
		to wind down with some exercise üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Another interest I have is dirt biking, I'm still a complete
		novice getting and my feet wet but it can be quite the rush flying through the forest on narrow
		trails.
